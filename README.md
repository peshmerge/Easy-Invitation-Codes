# Easy-Invitation-Codes BuddyPress Version

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stephenhouser/Easy-Invitation-Codes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stephenhouser/Easy-Invitation-Codes)

This is a fork that adds in [BuddyPress](https://buddypress.org) support into the [Easy Invitation Codes](https://github.com/peshmerge/Easy-Invitation-Codes) fork of [baw-invitiation-codes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/baw-invitation-codes/) originally by [Juliobox](http://wp-rocket.me/). It merges in much of the work that was done in the 'Develop/BuddyPress' version of [baw-invitiation-codes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/baw-invitation-codes/) with the fixes from [Easy Invitation Codes](https://github.com/peshmerge/Easy-Invitation-Codes) and a little bit more.

This is UNOFFICAL fork of Easy Invitation Codes Wordpress plugin https://wordpress.org/plugins/baw-invitation-codes/
I forked it and solved a couple of problems and php warnings. I use the plugin on of my client's site and it was so annoying that the proplem wasn't solved. So I decided to solve the problems and release my own version without ignoring  the original author and the maker of the plugin. 

## Installation
Download the repo and upload the folder baw-invitation-codes to your wp-content/plugins/ folder via FTP

## Changelog
-  All invitation codes are now UPPERCASE to avoid inconsistency 
-  Fixed two PHP notices and warnings and one exception. 

# Original README
This link leads to the readme file of the plugin https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/baw-invitation-codes/trunk/readme.txt
