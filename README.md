# Easy-Invitation-Codes

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/peshmerge/Easy-Invitation-Codes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/peshmerge/Easy-Invitation-Codes)

This is UNOFFICAL fork of Easy Invitation Codes Wordpress plugin https://wordpress.org/plugins/baw-invitation-codes/
I forked it and solved a couple of problems and php warnings. I use the plugin on of my client's site and it was so annoying that the proplem wasn't solved. So I decided to solve the problems and release my own version without ignoring  the original author and the maker of the plugin. 

## Installation
Download the repo and upload the folder baw-invitation-codes to your wp-content/plugins/ folder via FTP

## Changelog
-  All invitation codes are now UPPERCASE to avoid incosistency 
-  Fixed two PHP notices and warnings and one exception.
